# Hello, Earl

A really simple first person game, that might become something more later.

This template contains:
- Player controller with basic movement (crouching, walking, looking with your mouse, etc)
- Interactions (Interactibles3D)
- Basic pause menu
- Basic main menu
- A mysterious atmosphere
- that's about it
